        <h2>Why Packfilm?</h2>

        <p>Back in a day, when film was big there was a type of instant film for professionals. So that they could do a test shot before using a non-instant film. It's name was Packfilm. As digital grew the demand in film declined. The last stock of Packfilm has been discontinued in 2000.</p>
        <p>So, with the history in mind, you think of Instagram as an instant film for the masses anf Packfilm as Instagram feed for power users.</p>


        <h2>So how does Packfilm work?</h2>

        <p>Since Instagram doesn't have any API for fetching the feed, Packfilm tries it's best to fetch the most recent posts of your friends and organize them in a chronological feed.</p>
        <p>Please keep in mind that there're certain API limits, so if you follow a lot of people Packfilm will most probably fetch only a part of your feed.</p>
        <p>Just login to all of your accounts one by one and Packfilm will store the tokens in the local storage of your browser so that you'll see your feed the next time you open the page.</p>

        <p>Aside from the limitations Packfilm feed is your regular feed where you can like and comment (to be implemented) on posts on the behalf of a respective account.</p>

        <p>To put it in a simple words: if you have more than one account and it's not critical for you to see every single photo from your feed but rather the general picture - Packfilm is for you!</p>

        <p>Film will always stay in our ❤️</p>
